*	Install autohotkey version 1 (optional as i have included a compiled version of the helper)

Create a folder somewhere safe and unobtrusive
	Move the folllowing into the folder:
The .dll file RecipeThumbnailProvider.dll
The AutoHotKeyThumbHelper script either .ahk or .exe
The register_handler.bat

Now run the register_handler.bat as admin. (Not sure if admin is actually required).

if theres an issue you could also try run the registry file included before retrying the steps.
