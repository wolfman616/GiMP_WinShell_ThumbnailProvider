*	Install autohotkey version 1 (optional as i have included a compiled version of the helper)

create a folder on the C Drive "script" and create a subfolder "ahk" inside that folder  
The path will be this:
C:\Script\AHK
Move or copy the AutoHotKeyThumbHelper script either .ahk or .exe into this location.

Create another folder somewhere safe and unobtrusive
	Move the folllowing into the folder:
The RecipeThumbnailProvider.dll .dll file 
The register_handler.bat

Now run the register_handler.bat (as admin. (Not sure if admin is actually required)).

if theres an issue you could also try run the registry file included before retrying the steps.
